  Initialize the Cytopus KnowledgeBase and generate a JSON file containing a nested dictionary with gene set annotations organized by cell type, suitable for input into the Spectra library.
arguments:
  - name: celltype_of_interest
    description: List of cell types for which to retrieve gene sets
    type: list
  - name: global_celltypes
    description: List of global cell types to include in the JSON file.
    type: list
  - name: output_file
    description: Path to the file where the output JSON file should be stored.
    type: str
returns:
  - name: keys
    description: The list of keys in the produced JSON file.
    type: list
example:
  arguments:
    - name: celltype_of_interest
      value: ["B_memory", "B_naive", "CD4_T", "CD8_T", "DC", "ILC3", "MDC", "NK", "Treg", "gdT", "mast", "pDC", "plasma"]
    - name: global_celltypes
      value: ["all-cells", "leukocyte"]
    - name: output_file
      value: /mount/output/Spectra_dict.json
test_invocations:
  - name: B_and_CD4_T
    arguments:
      - name: celltype_of_interest
        value: ["B", "CD4_T"]
      - name: global_celltypes
        value: ["all-cells", "leukocyte"]
      - name: output_file
        value: /mount/output/Spectra_dict.json
  - name: leukocytes

        value: ["B_memory", "B_naive", "CD4_T", "CD8_T", "DC", "ILC3", "MDC", "NK", "Treg", "gdT", "mast", "pDC", "plasma"]
      - name: global_celltypes
        value: ["leukocyte"]
      - name: output_file
        value: /mount/output/Spectra_dict.json
  - name: Treg_and_plasma_and_B_naive
    arguments:
      - name: celltype_of_interest
        value: ["Treg", "plasma", "B_naive"]
      - name: global_celltypes
        value: ["leukocyte"]
