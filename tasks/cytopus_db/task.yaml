  Initialize the Cytopus KnowledgeBase and generate a JSON file containing a nested dictionary with gene set annotations organized by cell type, suitable for input into the Spectra library.
arguments:
  celltype_of_interest:
    description: List of cell types for which to retrieve gene sets
    type: list
  global_celltypes:
    description: List of global cell types to include in the JSON file.
    type: list
  output_file:
    description: Path to the file where the output JSON file should be stored.
    type: str
returns:
  keys:
    description: The list of keys in the produced JSON file.
    type: list
example:
  arguments:
    celltype_of_interest: ["B_memory", "B_naive", "CD4_T", "CD8_T", "DC", "ILC3", "MDC", "NK", "Treg", "gdT", "mast", "pDC", "plasma"]
    global_celltypes: ["all-cells", "leukocyte"]
    output_file: /mount/output/Spectra_dict.json
test_invocations:
  B_and_CD4_T:
    arguments:
      celltype_of_interest: ["B", "CD4_T"]
      global_celltypes: ["all-cells", "leukocyte"]
      output_file: /mount/output/Spectra_dict.json
  leukocytes:
    arguments:
      celltype_of_interest: ["B_memory", "B_naive", "CD4_T", "CD8_T", "DC", "ILC3", "MDC", "NK", "Treg", "gdT", "mast", "pDC", "plasma"]
      global_celltypes: ["leukocyte"]
      output_file: /mount/output/Spectra_dict.json
  Treg_and_plasma_and_B_naive:
    arguments:
      celltype_of_interest: ["Treg", "plasma", "B_naive"]
      global_celltypes: ["leukocyte"]
      output_file: /mount/output/Spectra_dict.json
