  env:
    # Here, you can specify environment variables that should be available for installing the repository or running the task.
    # The format is key: value, where value is a string that can include variables from the local environment.
    # You may also leave this empty if the repository does not require any tokens/secrets.

category: pathology # Category of the task.
description: Perform feature extraction on an input image using CONCH. # Description of the task. This should be 1-3 sentences in length, explaining to the LLM what this tool should do.
arguments:
  # Arguments of the task. The key is the name of the argument and the value is a dictionary with the keys "description" and "type".
  # For example, the following 3 lines define an argument "input_image" with a description "Path to the input image" and a type "str".
  input_image:
    description: Path to the input image
    type: str  # supported types are "str", "int", "float", "bool", "list", "dict"
  # You may define more arguments as needed...
returns:
  # Define the outputs of the task here, in the same way as the arguments are defined.
  # Here, we just define a single output "features", but you may define more as needed.
  features:
    description: The feature vector extracted from the input image, as a list of floats
    type: list
example:
  # Below, we define an example invocation of the task, i.e. a specific input to the tool.
  # This section is required, and it consists of "arguments" and "mount" (see below).
  arguments:
    # For each input argument, specify the value to be used for the example invocation.
    input_image: /mount/input/TUM-TCGA-ACRLPPQE.tif
  mount:
    # In this section, you can specify files or folders that should be mounted from the data directory to the container (at "/mount/input" in the container).
    # The format is key: value, where key is the name of the file or folder and value is the path to the file or folder in the data directory.
    # For example, the following line mounts the file "TUM-TCGA-ACRLPPQE.tif" from the data directory to the container, placing it at the path "/mount/input/TUM-TCGA-ACRLPPQE.tif" in the container.
    TUM-TCGA-ACRLPPQE.tif: TUM-TCGA-ACRLPPQE.tif
test_invocations:
  # Below, we define test invocations for the task.
  # Each test invocation is a dictionary with the keys "arguments" and "mount", like the example invocation above.
  # The test invocations can be used in the unit tests to check that the task is working as expected.
  # Below, we define 3 test invocations for the task, named "tif", "png", and "jpg". 
  # It is recommended that you define at least 3 test invocations (of course, you can choose any names you want).
